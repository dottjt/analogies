  <div class="section">
    <h2>The reason why it’s called self-awareness, is because you need to identify your configuration before you can change it.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Which is to say that many of us are not even aware of the control panel in our minds.</h2>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>You see, mental illness is a symptom.</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>As opposed to a trait.</h2>
    <h3>(such as having blue eyes or prefering Italian food.)</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Basically, mental illness is the result of many different traits interacting together.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Traits we've developed since birth.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>For example, being driven and obsessive doesn’t make you mentally ill.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>However, pursuing those behaviours unchecked can result in mental illness.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>No different to being too confident or thoughtful for too long.</h2>
    <h3>(which can develop into arrogance and self-consciousness).</h3>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Self-awareness is desgined to provide us with those checks and balances.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>So we can prevent mental illness in our lives.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>And retain a calm and calculated state of mind.</h2>
