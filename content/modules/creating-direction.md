    <h1>This is gratitude.</h1>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>For our first exercise we're going to start with gratitude.</h2>
    <div class="graph" id="normalBrain"></div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>And contrary to popular belief, this exercise has almost nothing to do with being grateful.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>It goes much deeper than that.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Before we get to that point however, what is gratitude?</h2>
  </div>
  
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Well, it’s important to understand that it can be absolutely anything you want it to be.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>It can be a feeling. It can be a state of mind. It can be a simple thought.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>There are millions of ways you can express gratitude.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Yet how you express gratitude is irrelevant.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What’s truly remarkable is the fact that you expressed something.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>That you created some form of expression from your mind.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>So what does this tell us?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>For starters, it tells us that you have the ability to direct your mind.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>That you’re not completely victim to your mental illness.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>And that’s about it.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Basically, that you can direct your thoughts, opinions and judgements.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Of course, self-awareness is a skill.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Which means you must practice it in order to get better.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>And these realisations can only make sense through practice.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>So I want you to ask yourself on a daily basis:</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What are you most grateful for today and how do you express it?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>And when you’re doing it, I want you to take notice of how you express it.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Was it a thought? Perhaps a simple gesture? Via some form of self-respect?</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Ask it when you have a spare moment to think, and really try and identify what took place.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Then once you feel comfortable expressing gratitude, you can move onto the next exercise.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Remember, one skill at a time.</h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h3>In the next exercise we'll </h3>
