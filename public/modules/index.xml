Before we get to that point however, what is gratitude? 
Well, it’s important to understand that it can be absolutely anything you want it to be. 
It can be a feeling.</description>

      <description>This is self-awareness.   Self-awareness is an interface for your brain.   
That allows you to control your mind.  
This course aims to teach you to identify these configurations. 
As well as how to adjust them in order to create balance in our minds. 
The reason why it’s called self-awareness, is because you need to identify your configuration before you can change it.</description>
