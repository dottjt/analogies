      <description>This is gratitude.  For our first exercise we&amp;rsquo;re going to start with gratitude.  
And contrary to popular belief, this exercise has almost nothing to do with being grateful. 
It goes much deeper than that. 
Before we get to that point however, what is gratitude? 
Well, it’s important to understand that it can be absolutely anything you want it to be. 
It can be a feeling.</description>

      <description>This is your brain.   Each line represents a thought, an opinion or a judgement.  
Collectively they provide us with direction.  
In order to make informed decisions. (i.e. dance to your favourite 90s&amp;rsquo; mixtape). 
On the contrary, this is clarity.  
Clarity allows us to single out our thoughts, opinions and judgements.  
In order to evaluate them. (so we can decide to keep them or let them go).</description>

      <title>Self-awareness</title>

      <description>This is self-awareness.   Self-awareness is an interface for your brain.   
That allows you to control how it functions.   
I suppose the reason why it’s called self-awareness&amp;hellip; 
&amp;hellip;is because you need to be aware of it in order to access it. 
Otherwise, all you really notice are the things happening inside your brain.  
As opposed to the control panel sitting beside it.</description>
