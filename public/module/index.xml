      <description>This is your brain.   Each line represents a thought, an opinion or a judgement.  
Collectively they provide us with direction.  
In order to make informed decisions. (i.e. dance to your favourite 90s&amp;rsquo; mixtape) 
On the contrary, this is clarity.  
Clarity allows us to single out our thoughts, opinions and judgements.  
In order to evaluate them. (so we can decide to keep them or let them go).</description>

      <description>Self-awareness is a skill that is designed to provide you with control.   To slow down your mind.

To dissolve what’s currently active in your mind.

To change your mind’s focus and act with intention.

The problem with mental illness is that we lose the ability to the control our mind.

We live with imbalance for so long that we assume that this is how we&amp;rsquo;ve always been.</description>
