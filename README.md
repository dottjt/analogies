The successor to [Character Jump](https://github.com/dottjt/CharacterJumpTwo).

Basically, what I was finding was that I was writing an incredibly extensive how-to guide, in addition to the software - which purposefully defeated the point of even having software within the first place.

It also made me realise that words may not necessarily be the most suitable medium. They simply don't have the power to convey concepts without creating too much verbosity. That's when I realised a more minimal, symbolic-based approach using interactive visualisations might be more suitable.

This project primarily utilises PIXI.js to create the visualisations via WebGL, and the visualisations will be presented in a course-like structure. The website has been structured utilising Hugo and Webpack, with React for some of the UI. 

It's been working really well so-far, so we'll see how I go.
